The Honinbos had lost their star players to early deaths, and Shuhaku, next in line, was very young and barely 7d, yet (as Honinbo, in the absence of a Meijin) was ranked first in the Godokoro. He too died early, during a challenge match to create some face for himself. His death allowed the shogi players to press their claim for alternation of the Godokoro and Shogidokoro as head of the games world, with other heads in either game ranked according to seniority, rather than ranked by seniority in go first, with shogi players (apart from the Shogidokoro, who ranked behind the Godokoro) bringing up the rear. The shogi claims were strengthened by having an outstanding Shogidokoro in Ito Sokan and a shogi-loving Commissioner of Shrines & Temples (the Jisha Bugyo) at the time, Lord Inoue of Kochi. However, he died (in Iyo) at a critical time, and the decision on precedence was passed to his successor, Lord Okada Tadasuke of Echizen, who was a go fan. This was where Aihara came in. He had been introduced to the Shogun Ienobu as a go prodigy at the age of 12 and had been given a considerable stipend of 60 bushels of rice a year, 10 bushels higher than the family heads. He also had a splendid mansion in Mita. Ienobu was a lover of both go and shogi, and other young players of both games had been introduced to him at the same time (Tsubota Ganseki, plus shogi players Miyamoto Insa and Ariura Inri). But Aihara had a chance to shine above the others when the Ryukyuan mission visited Japan in 1711 and he handsomely defeated Yara no Satonushi. He had to take White and it was seen as a major responsibility. His play at 13 was considered worthy of a family head. He was an obvious candidate to play in castle games, but this was considered inappropriate because of his close connection with the shogun. Instead he devoted his efforts to training the young Honinbo. This, and his international victory, cemented go's leading position and the shogi challenge died out. His last known game was in 1763. He reached 7d but was largely lost to the go world through being obliged to serve Ienobu personally.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1698,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"JP","obaciqte0",FALSE,1710,1763,13,53,FALSE

The final Zero (as of October 2017) version: only used the black and white stones from the go board as its input, whereas previous versions of AlphaGo included a small number of hand-engineered features; used one neural network rather than two (earlier versions used a policy network to select the next moves to play and a value network to predict the winner of the game from each position; these were combined in AlphaGo Zero); AlphaGo Zero does not use rollouts (fast, random games from current position) as used by other programs to predict winner, but relies on its high quality neural networks for evaluations.",NA,NA,NA,"Beat Fan Hui 5-0 (2015).

Chikun, the second youngest of seven children (two elder brothers, one younger who died in infancy, and three girls), moved to Japan in 1962-08 at the initiative of elder brother Cho Shoen who later effectively became his manager. The brothers all had the character yeon in their names (see Cho Shoen) and Chikun was originally called Pung-yeon. But an amateur fortune-teller told the family that if Pung-yeon did not change his name his mother would die, whereas if he did his baby brother would die but then Pung-yeon would become famous. So his father renamed him Chikun. The baby did die, despite constant attention. A professional fortune-teller later predicted that Chikun would become a famous person known to all in Korea. He has no recollection himself but it is said he learnt go from his grandfather - his father was too weak, never getting beyond 5-6 kyu. But when he showed aptitude for the game it was his father who decided he should go to Japan. He flew off with Cho Nam-ch'eol to join Kitani's school (his brother Cho Shoen had also already gone to Japan a year earlier) and the very next day he was pitted against Rin Kaiho, then 6d, at the Sankei Hall in front of a vast public. He took the game very seriously, folding his arms as he sank into thought, and had to be nudged to play faster for the audience, although he had actually been told to by his uncle and brother to fold his arms before every move to avoid the possibility of making errors through playing too fast. He won the game (1962-08-02). About a year after joining Kitani, he also enrolled as a 10-kyu insei at the Nihon Ki-in. He found it hard, being beaten down from 5 stones handicap to 9 stones in straight games (the handicap was adjusted after every game) against fellow Kitani disciple Kato Masao, for example, and on two occasions he even had to take ten stones. He was often reduced to tears but he made an impression by doggedly playing on with eyes streaming. Other children were apt to bully him - he was after all not Japanese. But as the baby of the Kitani family he was also rather indulged, and took advantage by being, by his own admission, a naughty child and he told fibs. His go studies suffered because he was cheeky to his fellow pupils and so they would not play teaching games, though they also recognised he was clever. His neglect of study was made more noticeable by the arrival of his future rival Kobayashi Koichi in the school. Kobayashi was three years older and weaker, but he studied very hard. Cho settled down somewhat at the age of seven when his mother, Ok-sun, came to Japan and comforted him by allowing him to suckle again. A crisis arose when his mother decided it was time to go home, but one famous incident that made Cho himself stick it out in Japan was when he was taken to the house of a wealthy patron of Kitani in Kobe, Takeoka Shiro (executive director of the Obayashi-gumi). Takeoka owned a large painting of a tiger. When Cho saw it he was goggle-eyed. Takeoka offered it to him, but Kitani interceded to impose a condition: he could have it if he reached 1d by the age of ten. In fact he did not reach this status until he was 11, but Mrs Kitani phoned Takeoka anyway and the present was duly delivered. It was probably Mrs Kitani who was most influential in keeping Cho in Japan - she adored him and spoilt him when he was very young - but the topic of a return to Korea was always in everyone's thoughts, including hers. He wore her out, he engaged in battles of will with her, and she more than once expressed misgivings to her husband about being able to give him a suitable upbringing. But one little incident that helped changed the mood was taking him to Mitsukoshi to buy his first suit - he was wreathed in smiles for a change. Mr Kitani volunteered to talk to Cho Nam-ch'eol about sending Chikun home, but he had another Korean pupil, Ha Ch'an-seok, who become a good friend of Chikun and the tribulations were tided over. It was Chikun himself who made the major change necessary when he did not make 1d at the age of 10, for it was his failure to do that that suddenly spurred him on to become a ferocious student. The tag of being a ""difficult"" child began to fade. He remains, however, a person of great passion. He claims he thinks of death whenever he loses, and he cannot stand being second. But in his career since then he has not often had to accept second best. He suffered a major traffic accident in 1986-01 but his legendary determination came to the fore and became the only player to contest a title match in a temporary wheelchair and plaster cast, in the Kisei. He holds, or held, several major records in tournament play: youngest 1d (11), youngest 9d in Nihon Ki-in (24, after 110 games with a winning percentage of 80.5%), youngest title holder (17 years 0 months: Shinei Tournament 1973 - since overtaken by Iyama Yuta), youngest major title winner (Pro Best 10, aged 18 in 1975), first to win Big Three titles (Kisei, Meijin, Honinbo, in 1983, repeated in 1996). He became the 25th Lifetime Honinbo after winning this tournament for a record 10 successive terms in 1998. 5th player to record 1,000 wins. He equalled Sakata Eio's record of 64 titles on 2002-08-17 when he won the 35th Hayago Championship (his tally began in 1973 with the 5th Shinei). He has since (as of 2006-07 with the 44th Judan) taken the total to 69, not counting pair go titles. He became the youngest to reach 1200 career wins on 2005-01-27 (third to this target after Kato Masao and Rin Kaiho), and became 2nd to record 1300 career wins on Japan in 2008-06-19 (681 losses, 3 jigo, 4 void). His Honinbo style is Honinbo Chikun. He is the nephew of Cho Nam-ch'eol, younger brother of Cho Shoen, cousin of Ch'oe Myeong-hun and uncle of Yi Seong-chae, and distantly related to Ch'oe Kyu-pyeong. His daughter became an insei in 1990, which became the occasion for Cho (very unusually for A leading player) to become for two years an insei instructor to ""repay his debt"" to Japanese go. Although he retains Korean nationality, he has a Japanese wife and Japanese is now his main language. As of 2010-12-02 he became the holder of the record for most career wins (1364-733-3-4), one ahead of Rin Kaiho. His Honinbo style is 本因坊治勲. He was awarded the Medal of Honour with Purple Ribbon in 2019. The birthdate 1956-07-23 is also given in the literature. He became the first player to hold the top three titles (Kisei, Honinbo, Meijin) simultaneously on two separate occasions, in 1996.",NA,"16th Prime Minister's (1972), 4th Shinei (1972), 22nd NK Championship (1975), 25th Oza (1977), 2nd Shinjin-O (1977), 5th Gosei (1980), 27th NHK (1980), 7th Gosei (1982), 38th Honinbo (1983), 21st Judan (1983), 10th Meijin (1985), 10th Kisei (1986), 12th Gosei (1987), 35th Oza (1987), 19th Hayago (1987), 7th NEC (1988), 15th Tengen (1989), 28th Judan (1990), 29th Judan (1991), 2nd Ryusei (1992), 4th Tong Yang (1993), 13th NEC (1994), 1st Agon-Kiriyama (ACOM) (1994), 16th Kakusei (1994), 19th Kisei (1995), 43rd Oza (1995), 14th NEC (1995), 17th Kakusei (1995), 1st JT (1995), 17th NEC (1998), 5th Agon-Kiriyama (ACOM) (1998), 7th Ryusei (1998), 4th JT (1998), 54th Honinbo (1999), 47th Oza (1999), 24th Kisei (2000), 25th Meijin (2000), 48th Oza (2000), 7th Agon-Kiriyama (2000), 48th NHK (2001), 27th Meijin (2002), 50th Oza (2002), 46th Judan (2004), 51st NHK (2004), 32nd Kisei (2008), 55th NHK (2008), 17th Agon-Kiriyama (2010), 31st NEC (2012), 7th Daiwa (2012), 2nd Igo Masters (2012), 24th Ryusei (2015), 23rd Agon-Kiriyama (2016), 7th Igo Masters (2017)","1970 Oteai B, 1971 Oteai B, 5th Shinei (1973), 6th Shinei (1974), 12th Pro Best Ten (1975), Eight Strongest (1976), 24th Oza (1976), 8th Shinei (1977), 4th Gosei (1979), 1979 Oteai A, 5th Meijin (1980), 6th Meijin (1981), 36th Honinbo (1981), 7th Meijin (1982), 37th Honinbo (1982), 20th Judan (1982), 4th Kakusei (1982), 1st Shusai (1982), 7th Kisei (1983), 8th Meijin (1983), 30th NHK (1983), 8th Kisei (1984), 9th Meijin (1984), 3rd NEC (1984), 9th Kisei (1985), 7th Kakusei (1985), 4th NEC (1985), 11th Gosei (1986), 18th Hayago (1986), 13th Tengen (1987), 26th Judan (1988), 14th Tengen (1988), 44th Honinbo (1989), 27th Judan (1989), 45th Honinbo (1990), 23rd Hayago (1990), 4th Fujitsu (1991), 46th Honinbo (1991), 24th Hayago (1991), 1st Ryusei (1991), 47th Honinbo (1992), 39th NHK (1992), 25th Hayago (1992), 48th Honinbo (1993), 3rd Ryusei (1993), 18th Kisei (1994), 49th Honinbo (1994), 42nd Oza (1994), 50th Honinbo (1995), 20th Kisei (1996), 21st Meijin (1996), 51st Honinbo (1996), 43rd NHK (1996), 29th Hayago (1996), 2nd JT (1996), 21st Kisei (1997), 22nd Meijin (1997), 52nd Honinbo (1997), 22nd Kisei (1998), 23rd Meijin (1998), 53rd Honinbo (1998), 23rd Kisei (1999), 24th Meijin (1999), 19th NEC (2000), 49th Oza (2001), 20th NEC (2001), 34th Hayago (2001), 9th Agon-Kiriyama (2002), 35th Hayago (2002), 8th Samsung (2003), 2nd JAL Super Hayago (2004), 43rd Judan (2005), 44th Judan (2006), 45th Judan (2007), 54th NHK (2007), 1st Igo Masters (2011), 4th Igo Masters (2014), 5th Igo Masters (2015), 3rd Japan Titlewinners (2016), 5th Daejoo (2018), 9th Igo Masters (2019), 2nd Teikei Legends (2023)",NA,"""My game consists in bringing everything together without using set patterns of play.

At age 6 he played Cho Nam-ch'eol on 9 stones and became an insei at age 7. He became 1d in Korea in 1962 (youngest ever, age 9) and 2d in 1963 but in October that year he moved to Japan to study as a live-in pupil under Segoe Kensaku, becoming an insei again but now 4k under the Japanese system. In Japan he reached both 1d and 2d in 1967. At this time he was also studying under Fujisawa Hideyuki, but returned to Korea as 5d in 1972-03 to complete his military service in the air force (where he suffered some discrimination because of his Japanese links).

His Japanese grade was accepted in Korea and reached 9d there (the first in Korea) in 1982. By far the most prolific winner of titles in Korean go, he held all nine titles in 1980. He was also the first player to win all (then) three international titles (Ing, Fujitsu and Tong Yang).

They soon stopped playing as they found the game shallow, but were later surprised to see a Japanese man, Kitabatake Yasugoro, in a café reading a paper with a go column in it. They retrieved the paper and played over the game after deciphering the numerals and decided Black was ahead. But only 150 moves were given (i.e. White had won) and they were curious as to why. They later found the same man and he told them Black had resigned. Astonished, they re-examined the game and decided go was not so shallow after all. They started playing regularly with the Japanese man, and soon reached his grade. After about 18 months Emanuel Lasker, world chess champion, having just returned from 14 years in America, joined them and picked up the game quickly - he arranged go evenings at his house. Emanuel Lasker eventually was giving Kitabatake two stones, and when news came that a Japanese 1d would be passing through Berlin and would play them on 9 stones, he said, ""There isn't a man in the world who can give me 9 stones. I have studied the game for a year and I know I understood what they were doing."" But, despite playing in consultation and playing slowly, he was crushed and was heartbroken. Edward Lasker, however, was inspired to go to Tokyo to study go. By then working for the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft in Berlin, he asked for a transfer but was told he needed to speak English first. He therefore asked for a transfer to England in 1912-09. While there, war broke out. He was shipped to America rather than interned, thanks to a chess friend (he had won the London Championship in 1914). In New York he met go players Karl Davis Robinson and Harper's Magazine editor Lee Foster Hartman, but he went to live in Chicago until 1925. He then returned to New York and set up a go club with Robinson and Hartman and some German immigrants at Lee Chumley's, a Greenwich Village restaurant. In 1934 he wrote a popular go primer, _[_Go and Go Moku_]_. He also played with many mathematicians at Princeton University. Japanese Minister of Education Hatayama Ichiro played Lasker on a visit to New York in the thirties, and he was also visited at home by Tsushima Juichi and received a Nihon Ki-in diploma. His go strength would probably be about 1d amateur today. Edward and Emanuel Lasker were related as thirds cousins twice removed, and Edward did sometimes refer to Emanuale specifically as a cousin, though at other times he cited him as either a close relative or a distant relative.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1885,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"EN","gf9xjjx42",FALSE,1935,1961,4,26,FALSE

Late in life he indicated he wished everyone to revert to Hideyuki but conceded that Shuko could be retained in usages such as Shuko's Study Tours. In his youth, after the second world war, he was classed as one of the Three Crows, along with Kajiwara Takeo and Yamabe Toshiro. At that time he was nicknamed Paranormal Fujisawa 異常感覚藤沢 (in the sense of having unusual sensitivity or aestheticism) by the writer pen-named Gengenshi. He was famous for living life to the full and as a man of extremes. As a fledgling professional in 1941 he lost all eight games in the Spring Oteai, then won all eight in the Autumn session. He won fame for winning (and then holding on to) the first Kisei title (one of several first titles he won) while making little impression elsewhere (though he did win 24 titles). He survived cancer three times and set a record for the oldest player (66) to defend a title (the Oza). He went against the grain of many Japanese in helping the Chinese, especially Nie Weiping, become strong, and he was also a notable moral supporter of Cho Hun-hyeon when the latter was struggling to win acceptance in Korea. His ""Shuko"" trips where he led young Japanese professionals overseas have also been influential. His collected games (1300+) were published in 1994. His tournament record was 863 wins, 655 losses and 8 ties. In 1999-11 he left the Nihon Ki-in to start his own business of issuing diplomas to amateurs - Nihon Ki-in diplomas were being criticised by him as too expensive, and he was critical also of some management. This led to a bitter war of words and the Ki-in formally expelled him in 1999-12. They afterwards refused to republish his books, but he returned in July 2003, by which time the Nihon Ki-in had new reform-minded directors and preparations for its 80th anniversary were looming. He was awarded the Medal of Honour with Purple Ribbon in 1987 and the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon (III) in 1997. The above birth-date is the one given in his autobiography ""Gouchi Shuko"" [_[_Gouchi Shuukou_]_] but Kido Yearbooks and other sources give the date 06-14, which was the date his birth was incorrectly registered at. It was not officially corrected until he got married. He died of aspiration pneumonia. He is the son of Fujisawa Jugoro, step-uncle of Fujisawa Hosai (even though older), father of Fujisawa Kazunari and grandfather of Fujisawa Rina.

Styled Guo Wennian 过文年. He was the scion of one of the illustrious families of the Wuxi region. The main source is his biography in _[_Cangxian-ji_]_ (Green Mountain Collection) by his fellow townsman Qin Songling. It says he was gifted and loved reading. He also liked playing go. A famous poem about him suggests he learnt go at the age of eight, but in any event Qin says that when in his 11th year, by watching others play, he understood about territory and void areas, sente and gote, the relationship between attack and defence and methods of managing them - and declared that go was not difficult. He played older players yet always won. His name reverberated around Wuxi. At that time an important official called Ye Xianggao (1558~1627, but as he graduated as jinshi in 1583 and became a Minister in 1607 this must have been between these dates, c. 1600), who was a Provincial Education Commissioner (xuetai) and later a Grand Secretary, came to Wuxi on business. He liked to play go and was at the level of taking two stones from a guoshou. He wanted to seek out the strongest player and play with him. Guo was therefore invited to attend. When Ye saw he was a mere boy he was quite astounded. Initially he did not believe Guo was his opponent, and then against his expectations he lost three games in a row. In the course of these games someone whispered to Guo that he was playing against a senior minister and should let him win one game. Although young Guo was already rather mature and angrily replied that, although go was a minor art, it was not possible to treat people like that when playing go and it would be shameful to let his opponent win just because he was a senior minister. And if he was a good official, surely he would feel sorry for a child. Ye saw that Guo's skill was supreme and that he was morally upright and completely virtuous. He therefore invited him to go to Beijing, China with him. Guo's education was not yet complete and so the offer was declined, but his fame spread until the nobles in Beijing heard of him (this was in the Wanli era 1573~1620) and he was finally prevailed on to go there. There was a senior guoshou, one of the most famous in Beijing, called Lin Fuqing, who looked down on the young Guo. One day, in the presence of some nobles, Lin challenged Guo, saying, ""Since you came to Beijing I still have not played you. I would like to play you today. It would give everyone the greatest pleasure."" The nobles were overjoyed and offered silver as a prize for the winner. Guo several times declined. Lin thought he was afraid and became all the more haughty, so that eventually Guo had no option but to play. Lin then lost three games in a row, to his great embarrassment. The nobles heaped even more praise on Guo. Therefore his fame spread throughout the empire and famous players came from all four corners to challenge him. He played them one by one and beat them all. In the ""Wuxi-xian Zhi"" (History of Wuxi County) it is written: ""When Guo opened the gates and let the enemy in, no-one dared look up at him. And so for several decades all go players regarded Guo Bailing of Wuxi as their paragon."" Apart from the _[_Guanzi Pu_]_ he wrote a manual on four-stone games.

By the next day news of his skill had reached the noted players of the area and he was invited to play, for a stake, in the Purple Clouds palace in the north of the city. The best player was chosen as his opponent and Liu took White and ceded him first move. By move 50 the onlookers were convinced White was losing, and his opponent declared Black had won. But Liu disagreed and 20 moves later began to sweep the stones off the board. His opponent angrily assumed he was trying to cover up his loss, but Liu smiled and said there were no strong players in Qiantang. He first began to play over ten or so games he had played the previous day, pointing out his opponents' errors. Then he began to replay faultlessly that day's unfinished game. He then said White needed just one move to ensure victory by at least 10 points. If anyone could find the move, he would give up and return home. No-one found it. He showed his move and said it would be effective 20 moves from now. Still no-one understood. Liu then proposed restarting the game. 20 moves later the position had changed drastically in White's favour, and when the game was completed he had won by 13 points. The onlookers gasped in admiration and Liu continued on to the capital. His reign there lasted some 20 years. He made important contributions to go theory, particularly through his still extant _[_Qi Jue_]_ (Go Secrets), drawing on Wang Jixin's _[_Ten Precepts_]_.

Within a year he improved three stones and was almost on a par with Fan. Fan's teacher Yu Yongjia introduced Fan and Shi to the 78-year old guoshou Xu Xingyou, who played them on three stones. They were taken to other famous patrons as a pair but Shi then was always a slight step behind Fan (and he was a slow, dour player in contrast to the fast-moving Fan) and so they were not pitted against each other properly until their famous close match at Danghu Lake, which took place in 1739. These are the only games between them that remain. Shi and Fan's collected games form the famous _[_Haichang Er Miao Ji_]_ (Two Marvels from Haining). Shi spent his late years in Yangzhou, teaching go but to very few pupils. In this period, in 1762, he wrote _[_Yili Zhigui_]_ (Go Theory Expounded). Five years later he had his pupil Li Liang compile a continuation. Because this work was extremely hard, being written in rhymed verse with many technical terms, Qian Changze of the great Songjiang clan (a former patron and a strong amateur particularly known for his discussions of go theory) rendered it into a popular version, which is the version that became famous as _[_Yili Zhigui Tu_]_ (Illustrated Go Theory Expounded).","Shi Dingan","GGD2763","He was styled Shi Xiangxia 施襄夏.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seizes the initiative by retaliation then keeps up the pressure.",NA,1710,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"CN","whiblqo8p",FALSE,1739,1739,11,0,FALSE

He settled in Nagoya in 1950 about the time he became 7d, and began to blossom at go. But success in go brought more taxing games and obligatory parties (sometimes three a night). Alcohol did not agree with him and he tried to avoid it by dancing but it caught up with him and by 1958 he had an advanced duodenal ulcer. A doctor advised surgery. But a week after the operation he suffered severe haemorrhaging and had to be operated on again. A week later (November 1958) he insisted on playing Hosokawa Senjin in the 4th Saikoi and after 296 moves was on course to win and earn 9d. But at that point he fainted and could not continue. Carbon monoxide from the hand-warmer had caused a coronary thrombosis. For a time after that he defaulted many games, and he lost his places in the Honinbo and Saikoi leagues. This was when he changed the characters in his name from 利博 to 俊宏, to change his luck (it worked).The 俊広 version of his name was his latest and preferred one.

He went to Tokyo at age 17 for further education, hoping to be a doctor, but decided on go as a career and so joined the Hoensha in 1902, also joining Iwasaki Kenzo as a pupil. He still graduated from middle school, at a time when only 2% of the population went to middle school. Through beating his teacher on two stones he was allowed to jump straight to 3d. He volunteered for the Nagoya Artillery Regiment in 1904 at the time of the Russo-Japanese War and served for one year. He then travelled for a couple  of years. Then he became a pupil of Honinbo Shuei as 3d. 4d 1912. His almost invincible record as Black at this time, even against Honinbo Shusai, and his achievement of winning 10 straight games in the _[_Yorozu Choho_]_ newspaper win & continue from 1914~18 earned him the nickname Asahi Shogun (General Rising Sun) 旭将軍. His ambitions led him to Singapore in 1916, after a visit to China, to manage a rubber plantation, but with the market failing he returned to Japan after 18 months. He called in on Kubomatsu Katsukiyo in the Kansai region. There he played Hashimoto Utaro on four stones and promised to be his teacher. However, the following year he returned to Singapore via Shanghai to settle his affairs at the rubber plantation, but again repatriated himself in 1921 after the market slumped. In the meantime Kubomatsu decided Hashimoto should go to Segoe Kensaku. He reached 6d in 1919 or 1921, depending on source. In 1922 he joined forces with Karigane Junichi, Segoe Kensaku and Takabe Dohei to form the Hiseikai. Like them he briefly supported the newly formed Nihon Ki-in in 1924 but soon left, for the Kiseisha, returning after about 18 months. The Nihon Ki-in promoted him by recommendation to 7d in 1926-04 when he rejoined (he was their oldest player), but part of the deal was that from 1927 he should play a 10-game match with Nozawa Chikucho 7d. He was leading 5-2-2 before Nozawa retired through ill health in 1930. Around this time Suzuki benefited from the patronage of Kagami Kenkichi. He reached 8d in 1942-03 (by recommendation - see also under Kato Shin), and was made honorary 9d 1957. He was one of the most prolific go writers and is known principally for his gigantic opus the _[_Igo Daijiten_]_ (a joseki dictionary which incorporates his students' work) of 1935. He famously made the comment ""too ambitious"" on 3. Q4 after 1. Q16, 2. D17 in the first game of the first Honinbo Tournament. He played in the first radio game in 1933-01 with Mitsuhara Itaro.

A month later he became a pupil of the Inoue family under Fujita Keisai 3d, with whom he spent about two years. He was noted as a very diligent student in this period, working from dawn to bedtime at household tasks, playing guests and studying games - he averaged about 2,800 games a year, including 250 with his teacher, progressing from 8 stones to Black. 1d 1855. In 1859 he played a 10-game match with Honinbo Shuho on 2 and 3 stones, scoring level. He said he benefited enormously from Shuho's kind comments. From 1859 to 1864 he toured the Kyoto Prefecture, Japan area as a player. He went to Tokyo, Japan in 1872 to test his go skill and became a member of the Hoensha. After excellent results against the top players he asked to be promoted to 5d. This was rejected as unconventional. Partly because of this he felt insecure about his future and left go completely for eight years to work as a civil servant. He returned to Hoensha in 1879. In 1883, through the intervention of Kajikawa Noboru, he was finally awarded a 5d diploma, then was promoted to 6d after a match with Takahashi Kinesaburo. The purity of his go made him a popular opponent for younger players trying to get diplomas - victory against him counted high. Another reason was that he never split hairs about fees - he made a small living as a landlord and was modest in his needs. He was a proud person but felt great shame that he did not serve in the Russo-Japanese War. In his late years there was some support for making him Inoue XV but he was overlooked because of his age.

Before Huang, he had famous encounters with Zhou Lanyu. In all, 84 of his games remain, including many with the top players Sheng Dayou, Zhou Lanyu and Wang Hannian. Wu Ruizheng said that whenever he lost, he never despaired and came back again ""like a new wave before the previous one had subsided,"" always bringing forth new ideas. He wrote the _[_Yi Wu_]_ (Go Awakenings) with his games against Guo Bailing, published in the Kangxi era, and works on two-stone and four-stone openings. He appears to have been regarded as the best player in Beijing after Huang's early death, until Xu Xingyou, then in middle age, beat him - Zhou was then known as veteran.
